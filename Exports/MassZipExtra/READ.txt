Do "NOT" move the exe from the Python folder if you want to move the exe make a shortcut or move the whole folder.
this is not been through extensive error testing if you find a bug please report it to my github ---> https://github.com/AaaaaaICO and what version you used

The python files for exe and standalone are different one may be slightly quicker than the other but it would be negligable

The standalone version cant place the moved zip files out of the current dir while the exe can.

anyway thank you for downloading star the repository if you liked it.
